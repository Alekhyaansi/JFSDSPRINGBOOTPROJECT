        <h2>Pesticides List</h2>
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h3>Herbicide - Weed Control</h3>
            <p>Herbicides are chemicals used to eliminate unwanted plants (weeds) that compete with crops for nutrients, sunlight, and space. They can be selective, targeting specific types of weeds, or non-selective, killing all vegetation they contact. Common herbicides include glyphosate and atrazine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h3>Insecticide - Insect Pest Management</h3>
            <p>Insecticides are used to control harmful insect populations that damage crops. They come in various forms such as sprays, dust, or soil applications. Key examples include organophosphates, pyrethroids, and neonicotinoids, which are effective in targeting insects like aphids, caterpillars, and beetles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h3>Fungicide - Protection Against Fungal Diseases</h3>
            <p>Fungicides prevent and treat fungal infections in plants, such as powdery mildew, rust, or blight. They work by inhibiting fungal growth or killing spores directly. Commonly used fungicides include copper-based compounds, azoxystrobin, and chlorothalonil.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h3>Nematicide - Nematode Control</h3>
            <p>Nematicides are used to protect crops from nematodes, microscopic worms that attack plant roots and cause yield loss. These chemicals help maintain healthy root systems and improve nutrient absorption. Examples include aldicarb and fluensulfone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h3>Biopesticide - Organic Pest Control Solutions</h3>
            <p>Biopesticides are derived from natural sources like plants, bacteria, or minerals. They are environmentally friendly and target specific pests without harming beneficial organisms. Examples include Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for controlling caterpillars and neem oil for repelling insects.</p>
